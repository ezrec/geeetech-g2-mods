// Set of rod-end shims for the Geeetech G2/G2s Delta Rostock Mini printer,
// to eleminate slop in the rod-end bearings.
//
// Install on the aluminum rod-end bearings prior to installing the rod-ends.
//
// Although 16 are printed, you only need the best 12.
// Measure with calipers - height of the shims should be no
// more than 0.6mm, and no less than 0.2mm.
